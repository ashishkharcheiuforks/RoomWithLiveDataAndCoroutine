# RoomWithLiveDataAndCoroutine
I have explained with code on how to use Kotlin's Coroutine to make Room Database Queries and Listen to changes and Update UI in Realtime with LiveData.
This screenshot displays the changes that has occured to the database, by listening to the table using livedata.
I also have to say that , Coroutine is great :-D
